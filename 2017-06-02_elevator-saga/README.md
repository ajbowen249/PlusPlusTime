# Elevator Saga
This week, we split into pairs and spent some time playing [Elevator Saga](http://play.elevatorsaga.com/). When we were done, we had a group discussion answering some questions:

```
1. What did you learn about the difficulties of elevator programming?
2. Where might these lessons about elevator programming apply to your normal work?
3. What did you learn (or rediscover) about JavaScript?
4. How did pair programming go for you?
```
