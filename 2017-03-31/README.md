# Connect Four bot

This challenge was to create a bot that could play Connect Four. The test harness was this [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ElectricToyCo/7u7mggo1/). My bot speicifically is isolated in `myBot.js`, and `connnect4.js` is the full test harness with everone's bots, which can be run via node. Players can be included or excluded by editing the collection starting at line 327.
